# Introduction #

[CDK](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cdk/index.php?title=Main_Page) (for Chemistry Development Kit) is the most widely used free cheminformatics library for Java.

I would like to include chemfp support in the CDK, either through CDK export or though jython support of this library plus the CDK APIs.
