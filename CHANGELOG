What's new in 1.1p2 (development)
=================================

Added "--target-format", to specify the format of the targets file.
(Thanks to Björn Grüning for the suggestion.)

Added "--query-format" as the preferred way to specify the format
of the queries file. The older term, "--in", is still supported
but deprecated.

Report problems if the query or target file is in the wrong format,
instead of giving a stack trace.

What's new in 1.1p1 (12 Feb 2013)
=================================

Fixed memory leaks caused by using Py_BuildValue with an "O" instead
of an "N". This caused the reference count on the return arena strings
to be too high, so they were never garbage collected. This should only
affect people who made and destroyed many arenas.

Removed unneeded lock in threshold arena searches. This should give
better parallelism when there are many hits (eg, with a low threshold)
when there are multiple threads.

What's new in 1.1 (5 Feb 2013)
==============================

New methods to look up a record, record index, or fingerprint given
the record identifier. These are:

  arena.get_by_id(id)
  arena.get_index_by_id(id)
  arena.get_fingerprint_by_id(id)

Added or updated all of the docstrings for the public API.

Documented that the search methods on the FingerprintArena instance
are deprecated - use chemfp.search instead. These will generate
warning message in the next release and after that will be removed.

Renamed arena.copy_subset() to arena.copy().

Changed the arena.copy() method so that by default it reorders the
fingerprints if indices are specified, and by default the (sub)arena
ordering is preserved.

Added a cache for getattr(subarena, "ids"). Otherwise subarena.ids[i]
took O(len(subarena.ids)) time instead of O(1) time.

Renamed chemfp.readers to chemfp.fps_io and decoders.py to
encodings.py. These were not part of the public API but may be in
upcoming versions, so it's best to change them now.

Detect and raise an exception if the metadata size doesn't match the
fingerprint size passed to the arena builder. Thanks to Greg Landrum
for spotting this bug!

What's new in 1.1b7 (patch release)
===================================

Fixed a problem when the code is compiled on an old compiler which
doesn't understand the POPCNT inline assembly then run on a machine
which implements POPCNT.

What's new in 1.1b6 (5 Dec 2012)
================================

Added methods to count the number of hits in the search results which
are within a given score range, and to compute the cumulative score
(also called the "raw score") of those hits. These are:

   SearchResults.count_all(min_score=None, max_score=None, interval="[]")
   SearchResults.cumulative_score_all(min_score=None, max_score=None, interval="[]")
   SearchResult.count(min_score=None, max_score=None, interval="[]")
   SearchResult.cumulative_score(min_score=None, max_score=None, interval="[]")

Arenas now have a "copy_subset(indices, reorder=True)" method. This
selects a subset of the entries in the arena and makes a new arena.
Here's how to select a random subset of 100 entries from an arena:

  import random
  subset_indices = random.sample(xrange(len(arena)), 100)
  new_arena = arena.copy_subset(subset_indices)

(NOTE: 'copy_subset' was renamed 'copy' for the final 1.1 release.)

Fixed a bug in the Open Babel patterns FPS output: the 'software' line
needed a space between the Open Babel and chemfp versions.


What's new in 1.1b5 (23 April 2012)
===================================

The command-line search tools support an --NxN option for when the
queries and targets are the same. (The search results do not include
the diagonal term.)  The implemention takes advantage of the symmetry
to get almost a two-fold performance increase. This option assumes
that everything will fit into memory.

Added public APIs for the symmetric searches.

New popcount algorithms:
  - Lauradoux and POPCNT versions contributed by Kim Walisch
      These are 2x and 3x faster than the original method.
  - SSSE3 version by Imran Haque, Stanford University
      This is about 2.5x faster than the original method.
      Use --without-ssse3 to disable support for that method.
  - Gilles method, which can be better than the original method.

The timings depend very much on the compiler, CPU features, and choice
of 32- vs 64- bit architecture. For example, Lauradoux is slower than
the lookup tables for 32 bit systems. chemfp selects the best method
at import run-time. Use chemfp.bitops.set_alignment_method to force a
specific method.

The new popcount algorithms require a specific fingerprint alignment
and padding. Use the new "alignment" option in load_fingerprints() to
specify an alignment. The default uses an alignment based on the
available methods and the fingerprint size. (It will be 8 or less
unless you have SSSE3 hardware but not SSE4.2, and your fingerprint is
larger than 224 bits, in which case it's 64 bytes.)

Optional OpenMP support. This is used when the query is an arena. If
your compiler does not support OpenMP then use "--without-openmp" to
disable it.

Support for RDKit's Morgan fingerprints.

Support for Daylight's Circular and Tree fingerprints (if you have
OEGraphSim 2.0.0 installed.)

New decoder for Daylight's "binary2ascii" encoding.

Fixed a memory overflow bug which caused crashes on some Windows and
Linux machines.

Changed the API so that "arena.ids" or "subarena.ids" refers to the
identifiers for that arena/subarena, and "arena.arena_ids" and
"subarena.arena_ids" refers to the complete list of identifiers for
the underlying arena. This is what my code expected, only I got the
implementation backwards. Two of the test cases should have failed
with swapped attributes but it looks like I assumed the computer was
right and made the tests agree with the wrong values. Also added more
tests to highlight other places where I could make a mistake between
'ids' and 'arena_ids.' This fix resolves a serious error identified by
Brian McClain of Vertex.

Moved most memory management code from Python to C. The speedup is
most noticable when there is a hit density (eg, when the threshold is
below 0.5).

Created a new 'Results' return object, which lets you sort the hits in
different ways, and request only the score, or only the ids, or both
from the hitlist.  The arena search results specifically are stored in
a C data structure. This new API greatly simplfies implementing some
types of clustering algorithms, reduces memory overhead, and improves
performance.

Added Alex Grönholm's 'futures' package as a submodule. It greatly
simplifies making a thread- or process pool. It is a backport of the
code in Python 3.2.

Added Nilton Volpato's 'progressbar' package as a submodule. Use it to
show a text-based progress bar in chemfp-based search tools.

Added an experimental "Watcher" module by Allen Downey. Use it to
handle ^C events, which otherwise get sent to an arbitary thread. It
works by spawning a child process. The main process listens for a ^C
and forwards that as a os.kill() to the child process. This will
likely only work on Unix systems.

What's new in 1.0 (20 Sept 2011)
================================

The chemfp format is now a tab-delimited format. I talked with two
people who have spaces in their ids: one in their corporate ids and
the other wants to use IUPAC names. In discussion with others, having
a pure tab-delimited format would not be a problem with the primary
audience.

The simsearch output format is also tab delimited.

Completely redeveloped the in-memory search interface. The core data
structure is a "FingerprintArena", which can optionally hold
population count information.

The similarity searches use a compressed row representation,
which is a more efficient use of memory and reduces the number
Python-to-C calls I need to make.

The FPS knearest search is push oriented, and keeps track of the
identifiers at the C level.

Major restructuring of the API so that public functions are at the top
of the "chemfp" package. Made high-level functions for the expected
common tasks of searching an FPSReader and a FingerprintArena.

The oe2fps, ob2fps, and rdkit2fps readers now support multiple
structure filenames. Each filename is listed on its own "source" line.

New --id-tag to use one of the SD tag fields rather than the title
line. This is needed for ChEBI where you should use --id-tag "ChEBI ID"
to get ids like "CHEBI:776".

New --aromaticity option for oe2fps, and a corresponding "aromaticity"
field in the FPS header.

Improved docstring comments.

Improved error reporting.

Added error handling options "strict", "report", and "ignore."

More comprehensive test suite (which, yes, caught several errors).


What's new in 0.95
==================

Cross-platform pattern-based fingerprint generation, and specific
implementations of a CACTVS/PubChem-like substructure fingerprint and
of RDKit's MACCS patterns.


What's new in 0.9.1
===================

Support for Python 2.5.

What's new in 0.9
=================

Major update from 0.5. Changes to the API, code
cleanup, new search API, and more. Since there are
no earlier users, I won't go into the details. :)
